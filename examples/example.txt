# Important slide

Lorem ipsum igitur
- Dolores sits amidst the trees.
- And thinks about nothing.

$$$ java
$ /* good code */
$ String greeting = "hello";
$ String audience = "world";
$ return String.format("%s %s!", greeting, audience);

$$$ java
$ /* bad code */
$ IGreetingFactory factory = GreetingFactory.getInstance();
$ IGreeting greeting = factory.createGreeting(GreetingType.CASUAL, Audience.WORLD);
$ return GreetingFormat.format(greeting);

~~~

# Less important slide

- Abstract, but not too abstract
-- Sometimes very direct
-- Other times not so much
- Hello, I am trapped in a greeting factory
- Dolores is with me

~~~

! Break?

||||||||

# Very important topic

- Agile
- Scrum
- Lean
- Buzzwords

||||||||

# Other topic

- I have a great idea for a start-up.
- It will run in The Cloud.
- It will have a public API to interface with.
- I think it will be a success story.

##Cascading selectors

$$$ css
$ tag.class
$ tag#id
$ tag tag .class
$ tag.class [tag] [tag][class]

But be aware:
- It's cascading somehow.

## Caveat: The Cloud
- Is it of a cascading nature as well?
- Let's discuss.

||||||||

## Content
- There's a lot of it on this page.
- Almost as much content as in my Cloud App.
- Subscribe now.

## More Content
- A lot of content for one slide.
- *slaps presentation*
- This bad boy can fit so much of it on one slide.

## Content
- Just a little more.
- Slide is almost full.
- A tiny amount more perhaps.

See, the text should get smaller to show everything on one page.

That's the whole point of this slide.

# Alternative: Atomic class styles

||||||||

$$$ html
$ <div class="Bfc M-10">
$   <a class="Fl-start Mend-10" href="http://twitter.com/xyz">
$	  <img src="xyz.jpg" alt="me" />
$   </a>
$	<div class="Bfc Fz-s">@xyz 14 minutes ago</div>
$ </div>

||||||||

$$$ css
$ .Bfc { overflow: hidden; zoom: 1; }
$ .M-10 { margin: 10px; }
$ .Fl-start { float: left; }
$ .Mend-10 { margin-right: 10px; }
$ .Fz-s { font-size: smaller; }

|||||||| end

- quick parsing
- reusable, portable
- granular
- but quite complex
